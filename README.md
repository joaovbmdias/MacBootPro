MacBootPro
=================
Switching to a new laptop is never a fun process, so here's some help.

MacBootPro is a simple bootstrapping script to help with the initial setup of a MacBook. It uses a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) Brewfile to install a predefined list of packages to avoid the website -> download -> install -> remove installer cycle and having to remember all those little utilitles that you only realize you're missing when you try to run them.

Future developments might include fetching dotfiles (e.g. from a git repo) and installing them.

# Usage
`./macbootpro.sh`
